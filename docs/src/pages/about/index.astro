                <h1 class="text-6xl font-bold tracking-tight">Unlike any other IAM platform</h1>

                    FerrisKey is not just another wrapper around OAuth2 or OpenID Connect.
                    It’s a ground-up, Rust-powered solution focused on performance, modularity, and developer happiness.
                </p>

                    <span class="bg-yellow-200 px-1 rounded">If you have worked with Keycloak or Auth0, FerrisKey will feel like home — just faster and friendlier.</span>

                        Built for Cloud-Native Environments
                    </h3>
                    <p class="mt-2 text-muted-foreground">
                        FerrisKey is designed from the ground up to thrive in Kubernetes environments. Thanks to its operator model and per-realm deployments, you can scale authentication workloads independently — no more scaling the whole system for a single busy tenant.

                        Rust-Powered Performance & Safety
                    </h3>
                    <p class="mt-2 text-muted-foreground">
                        Unlike Java-based IAM solutions, FerrisKey leverages Rust for both performance and security. That means memory safety, blazing-fast startup times, and low CPU usage — perfect for modern containerized workloads.
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <h3 class="flex items-center gap-2 text-xl font-semibold">
                        Modular and Extensible by Design
                    </h3>
                    <p class="mt-2 text-muted-foreground">
                        FerrisKey follows a hexagonal architecture that makes it easy to plug in custom logic. Want to integrate a bespoke login flow, an external MFA service, or custom credential backends? Everything is built to be cleanly extended — without forking the core.
